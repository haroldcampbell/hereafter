## Todo

There are still some things left to do! This is really just notes for me right now.

- Improve test coverage of stacktrace handling
- Jasmine support
- React native example
- Improve performance of scheduler
- Typings
- Add note about chai length/lengthOf to docs
- Get karma runner using phantomjs with sourcemaps for more accurate testing of realistic behavior
- Support chai's chainable functions
- Implement (much) longer polling for non-mocked endpoints?
- Allow configuration of number of poll attempts?
