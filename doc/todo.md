## Todo

There are still some things left to do! This is really just notes for me right now.

- Fix pending tests
- Jasmine support
- Get karma runner using phantomjs with sourcemaps for more accurate testing of realistic behavior
- React native example
- Typings
- Support chai's chainable functions
- Implement network call tracking with fetch api (and xmlhttprequest?)

## Maybe:
- Add note about chai length/lengthOf to docs
- Improve test coverage of stacktrace handling
